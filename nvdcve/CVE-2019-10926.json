Data transmitted between the device and the user can be obtained by an attacker in a privileged network position. The security vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which allows evesdropping the communication between the affected device and the user. The user must invoke a session. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability compromises confidentiality of the data transmitted. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."

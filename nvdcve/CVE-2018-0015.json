The AppFormix Agent exposes the debug console on a host where AppFormix Agent is executing. If the host is executing AppFormix Agent, an attacker may access the debug console and execute Python commands with root privilege. Affected AppFormix releases are: all versions of 2.7; 2.11 versions prior to 2.11.3; 2.15 versions prior to 2.15.2. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability, however, the issue has been seen in a production network. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue."

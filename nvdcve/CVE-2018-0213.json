The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges to access functionality that should be restricted. The attacker must have valid user credentials to the device to exploit this vulnerability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf69753."

By sending a datagram to the service over Port 4444/UDP with the ?Record Data Size? field modified to a specifically oversized value, the service will calculate an undersized value for the ?Total Record Size? that will cause an out-of-bounds read access violation that leads to a service crash. The service can be recovered with a manual reboot. The patches and details pertaining to these vulnerabilities can be found at the following Rockwell Automation Security Advisory link (login is required): https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/537599"

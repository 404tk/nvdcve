The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of proxy connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTPS CONNECT message to the Central Manager. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access public internet resources that would normally be blocked by corporate policies."

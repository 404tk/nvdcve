The vulnerability is due to the incomplete error handling of the SSL or TLS packet header during the connection establishment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL or TLS packet during the connection handshake. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNORT detection engine to unexpectedly restart, resulting in a partial DoS condition while the detection engine restarts. Versions prior to 6.2.3.4 are affected."
